# Injective RFQ Integrations

Use this skill when adding Injective RFQ to a frontend or when building an RFQ
quote monitoring tool. Keep the main flow simple: prefer the RFQ gateway for
trade settlement, and use manual TakerStream only when you need raw quote
diagnostics.

## Mainnet Parameters

The canonical mainnet RFQ contract address is:

```ts
export const RFQ_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'inj12stwq95jet57edcu4a65r48r46s9rzrs938n8k'
export const RFQ_WS_URL = 'wss://rfq.ws.injective.network'
export const RFQ_GATEWAY_URL = 'https://rfq.gateway.grpc-web.injective.network/'
export const RFQ_CHAIN_ID = 'injective-1'
export const RFQ_EVM_CHAIN_ID = 1776
export const RFQ_COLLECT_QUOTES_MS = 500
```

`RFQ_CHAIN_ID` is the Cosmos chain ID used in RFQ quote payloads and Cosmos
sign docs. Do not set it to `1776`. `RFQ_EVM_CHAIN_ID` is the numeric Injective
EVM chain ID used in EIP-712 domains, Web3Gateway signatures, and
`quote.evmChainId`.

## Choose The Path

Use the gateway autosign path for production browser trading:

1. Connect an EVM wallet and derive the user's Injective address.
2. Create a local ephemeral autosign key for that wallet.
3. Grant AuthZ to the autosign key and to the RFQ contract through
   Web3Gateway fee payer.
4. Build canonical RFQ input from market metadata and mark price.
5. Call `IndexerGrpcRfqGwApi.fetchPrepareAutoSign`.
6. Sign the returned `TxRaw` exactly as received.
7. Insert both autosign and fee-payer signatures in decoded signer order.
8. Broadcast and poll the tx for final reconciliation.

Use manual TakerStream only for diagnostics, special routing, quote uptime
checks, or latency-sensitive liquidation/arbitrage flows that need maker
allowlists/denylists. It exposes ACK/quote timing and raw maker identity; if
you accept manually, prefetch account sequence and timeout height before quote
collection so the signed accept tx can be broadcast immediately after selecting
a quote.

## Production Rules

- Do not rebuild gateway transactions. Sign the returned `bodyBytes` and
  `authInfoBytes` exactly.
- Do not assume autosign is signer index `0`. Decode `AuthInfo.signerInfos`,
  normalize pubkeys, and fill signatures in decoded signer order.
- Normalize protobuf-wrapped pubkeys. `AuthInfo.signerInfos[].publicKey.value`
  can be `0a21...raw-key` while SDK public keys are raw 33-byte compressed
  keys.
- Canonicalize every signed decimal string. RFQ signatures bind string bytes,
  so `"110.0"` and `"110"` are different values.
- Use human price ticks for RFQ prices. Exchange `minPriceTickSize` is often
  quote-decimal scaled.
- Position close is RFQ too: opposite direction, same quantity, `margin: "0"`.
- After a successful close, cancel active TP/SL intent lanes for that market.
- Keep quote collection windows short. Production retail flows should start
  with `500 ms`. Latency-sensitive taker bots can use `50-100 ms`, but should
  measure quote hit rate because some makers respond slower than 50 ms.
- For maker-routed flows, expose `onlyMakers`, `excludeMakers`, `minTtlMs`,
  `collectMs`, `priceCheck`, and `gasLimit` as explicit operational knobs.
- Direct RFQ accept paths should default near `2_000_000` gas. Mainnet
  synthetic executions have used about `1.34M` gas, so `1_000_000` can fail
  before revealing the maker's semantic error.
- Do not import `TxInclusionStrategy` or set `txInclusion` unless the installed
  SDK actually exports it. A missing export breaks Vite at runtime.

## Fast Gateway Execution

For a snappy browser UI, prefetch RFQ gateway orders when form inputs are valid
and stable, then reuse the prepared order on submit only if all submission
dependencies still match.

- Gate prefetch behind an explicit user or app setting. Background prepare
  traffic is useful, but it should be observable and easy to disable.
- Debounce and limit prefetches. Restart when quantity, worst price, direction,
  market, margin, leverage, subaccount, autosign address, or account sequence
  changes.
- Cache prepared gateway orders with a short TTL and a dependency fingerprint.
  Treat account sequence changes as invalidation.
- Consume a prepared order once a submit path uses it. Never reuse the same
  prepared tx or RFQ payload for a later click.
- If a matching prefetch is in flight on submit, wait only behind a bounded
  timeout. Fall back to click-time prepare when it stalls.
- Build close-position prepared orders with the same gateway path: opposite
  direction, position quantity, `margin: "0"`, and a worst-price guardrail.
- Track prepare lifecycle in observability: requested, skipped, cache hit,
  cache miss, stale dependency, timeout, success, and failure.

## RFQ Input Rules

For open requests, derive quantity from stake, leverage, and mark price:

- `quantity = floor((margin * leverage) / mark, minQuantityTickSize)`
- long worst price = `mark + slippage`, rounded up to price tick
- short worst price = `mark - slippage`, rounded down to price tick

For closes:

- direction is the opposite of the open position side
- margin is exactly `"0"`
- quantity is the position quantity, floored to quantity tick
- worst price is still a guardrail

Worst price is a guardrail, not an expected execution price. Seeing better
quotes than `mark +/- slippage` is normal.

## Optimistic Position UX

Optimistic RFQ frontend execution means updating user-visible state at gateway
match time, then reconciling against the chain and indexer. Chain-side
optimistic execution can make settlement faster, but the UI must still treat
pre-confirmation state as provisional.

- Show the submitted toast immediately on click, before slow validation,
  prepare, signing, or broadcast work.
- When the gateway returns matched quote details, emit the filled toast
  immediately and update the positions table before chain confirmation.
- Use the matched quote response for filled quantity and average price. Do not
  display requested quantity in fallback filled or settled toasts.
- Keep the chain-success toast quiet when a matched filled toast already fired.
- On a post-match broadcast or chain failure, roll back the optimistic position
  and show exactly one error toast: `Order reverted, please try again.`
- Suppress duplicate generic errors from the same failure path, such as
  `Contract execution failed`, once the revert toast has been shown.
- Preserve optimistic positions across market switches, stream restarts, and
  initial refetches until real indexer data confirms or invalidates them.
- Clear optimistic state on real position insert/update/delete for that market,
  explicit rollback, account reset, or expiry.
- While a market has an active optimistic position, keep stream suppression
  timers re-armed instead of letting stale fetched rows replace the provisional
  row.
- Disable close-position actions for optimistic rows until the position is
  confirmed by chain/indexer data.

Focused tests should cover event order, immediate submitted toast, matched
toast before broadcast completion, prepared-order reuse and consumption, stale
dependency invalidation, in-flight prefetch timeout, rollback, duplicate error
suppression, stream restart preservation, and disabled close actions.

## Maker Routing And Short TTL

When a flow must avoid specific makers, use manual TakerStream quote
collection and accept only filtered quotes. Gateway settlement is still the
recommended browser path, but if the gateway accepts the first quote from a
distressed or underfunded maker, the whole settlement can fail. Track quote
diagnostics per maker: maker address, price, quantity, TTL at selection,
rejection reason, and on-chain execution error.

For makers with sub-second or low-second TTLs, avoid post-quote RPCs. Prefetch
account sequence and timeout height, collect for the minimum usable window,
build the accept message locally, and broadcast immediately. A quote with
about `1.4s` TTL can expire if you wait `500 ms` and then fetch sequence/block
height after selection.

## AuthZ Setup

Use Web3Gateway fee payer for wallet-signed setup transactions so users do not
need an INJ balance just to authorize RFQ.

Grant two groups:

- App/autosign grantee: exchange order messages plus
  `/injective.wasmx.v1.MsgExecuteContractCompat`
- RFQ contract grantee:
  `/injective.exchange.v2.MsgPrivilegedExecuteContract`,
  `/injective.exchange.v2.MsgBatchUpdateOrders`, and
  `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend`

If setup asks users to pay gas, the integration is bypassing Web3Gateway.

## Browser USDC Payments

For browser USDC deposits, credits, fees, or other app-payment flows on
Injective EVM, do not ask MetaMask to send a direct ERC-20 transfer from the
user. Direct `USDC.transfer` calls make the user pay native INJ gas and can
show MetaMask's confusing `Sending Unknown` / fee-warning screen.

Prefer Circle USDC's EIP-3009 flow:

1. Build typed data for `TransferWithAuthorization`.
2. Ask the user to sign it with `eth_signTypedData_v4`.
3. Submit `transferWithAuthorization(from, to, value, validAfter, validBefore, nonce, v, r, s)`
   from a server facilitator / relayer.
4. Credit the user only after the relayed transaction receipt confirms the USDC
   `Transfer` event.

Mainnet Injective EVM native USDC:

```ts
export const INJECTIVE_EVM_CHAIN_ID = 1776
export const NATIVE_USDC_INEVM = '0xa00C59fF5a080D2b954d0c75e46E22a0c371235a'

export const usdcAuthorizationDomain = {
  name: 'USDC',
  version: '2',
  chainId: INJECTIVE_EVM_CHAIN_ID,
  verifyingContract: NATIVE_USDC_INEVM,
} as const
```

Important checks on the server:

- `from` must match the authenticated user's EVM address.
- `to` must be the expected app facilitator / treasury address.
- `validBefore` should be short, typically 10-20 minutes.
- `authorizationState(from, nonce)` must be false before relaying.
- `balanceOf(from)` must cover `value` before relaying.
- `verifyTypedData` / recovered signer must equal `from`.
- The facilitator must keep enough native INJ on Injective EVM to pay relay
  gas. If relaying fails with `sender balance < tx cost`, top up the
  facilitator's `0x` address with INJ, not USDC.

Use this pattern for USDC app payments even when the broader product uses RFQ
gateway fee-payer flows for trading and AuthZ setup. It keeps the user
experience consistent: users sign intent, the app handles gas.

## Known Maker Failure Modes

Record maker-level RFQ errors instead of collapsing all quote failures into a
single settlement error. Useful categories observed on mainnet include:

- maker position below maintenance, often from a liquidated account still
  quoting
- insufficient maker balance for the quote minimum quantity
- quote expired before the execution block
- out of gas before maker semantic checks completed

## Quote Probe / Uptime Mode

For tools that only test whether market makers are quoting, read
[references/quote-probe-uptime.md](./references/quote-probe-uptime.md). A probe can send
RFQ requests and collect quotes without accepting them on-chain. The taker key
must sign RFQ requests, but the wallet does not need funds unless a quote is
accepted.

Measure bid/short and ask/long separately:

- `RFQs sent`: RFQ requests opened for that side
- `Requests quoted`: RFQs that received at least one MM quote
- `MM quotes`: total raw maker quote responses
- `Best bid` / `best ask`: best sorted price for the side

`MM quotes` can exceed `RFQs sent` because one RFQ can receive multiple maker
responses. For example, `100 RFQs`, `69/100 requests quoted`, and `140 MM
quotes` means 69 requests got at least one response and those requests received
140 total maker quotes.

## Conditional TP/SL

TP/SL is a signed RFQ close intent, not an orderbook reduce-only limit:

- long position TP: `mark_price_gte`, direction `short`, margin `"0"`
- long position SL: `mark_price_lte`, direction `short`, margin `"0"`
- short position TP: `mark_price_lte`, direction `long`, margin `"0"`
- short position SL: `mark_price_gte`, direction `long`, margin `"0"`

Fetch `epoch` and `lane_version` from the RFQ contract before signing. After
editing or canceling a lane, re-query before signing fresh intents.
